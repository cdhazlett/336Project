The final project for Web Development. Fall2016, Christiaan Hazlett, Nathaniel Bender

Our Vision

We are creating a real-time card game website, where players will be able to create a room and invite friends, then play cards.  The site’s room management will be session based, similar to the way codeshare.io works. A unique URL will be assigned to a room, and then players can join by typing in that URL and entering their name.  Using this system we will implement the classic poker game, Texas Holdem. The game room view will show the player’s hand, and the other players in the room, as well as the community cards on the table.
